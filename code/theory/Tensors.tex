\section{Tensors}

Tensor notation is of importance when working in this field as the theory is mainly described in this form and it provides a consise way of formulating the theory. We will here assume that the reader is comfortable with linear algebra and quickly go through how tensors are handled. We will be using Einsteins tensor notation to describe our tensors. 

\subsection{Tensors}

In general a tensor is a geometric object that is used to describe relations between vectors, covectors, matricies and/or other tensors. A simple example describing a vector $\mathbf{v}$ in a basis $\mathbf{e}_i$ can we written as

$$\mathbf{v}=\sum_i v^i \mathbf{e}_i=v^i \mathbf{e}_i$$

where we can suppress the summation sign. This means that $v^i$ is the array of components for the vector.
